# Spell-Checker
Spell Checker 2:
To compile the program, first, you need to put your dictionary file and text file under the same folder with the .java files. The main method is in SpellChecker2.java, so you can run the program there. For the input, it is composed of three parts. First part you need to enter either "S" for simple sort, "C" for count sort, "T" for transpose sort. If you don't enter anything in front, it is in default using simple sort. Then follows the dictionary file name and text file name.

Spell Checker 3:
The algorithm of storing the dictionary and misspelled words changes to Hash instead. And we use a AVLTree to deal with the collision.

In the command line, type SpellChecker3 first, then the file name of dictionary, followed by the file name of text file.
Eg. > java SpellChecker3 30 dictionary.txt roll.txt
